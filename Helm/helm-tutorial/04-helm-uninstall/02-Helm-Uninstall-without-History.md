# Helm Uninstall without History 

## Step-01: Uninstall Helm Release - NO FLAGS
```sh
# List Helm Releases
helm list

# Uninstall Helm Release
helm uninstall <RELEASE-NAME>
helm uninstall myapp101

# List Helm Releases which are uninstalled
helm list --uninstalled
Observation:
We should not see uninstalled release, this command will completely remove the release and its all references

# helm status command
helm status myapp101
Observation:
As the release is permanently removed, we dont get an error "Error: release: not found"

# List Helm History
helm history myapp101
```

## Step-05: Rollback Uninstalled Release
```t
# Rollback Helm Uninstalled Release
helm rollback <RELEASE> [REVISION] [flags]
helm rollback myapp101 1 
Observation: 
Should throw error "Error: release: not found"
```
